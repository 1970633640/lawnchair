# Lawnchair

![Lawnchair](banner.png)

Lawnchair is the customizable Pixel Launcher alternative. This Repository contains our full rewrite from scratch (simply known as V11),
if you were looking for our older V1 sources you can find the archive [here](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair-V1).

## How to Contribute?

If you know Java/Android and have some Kotlin knowledge you should quickly be able to start contributing to Lawnchair.
Make sure to generally add any new classes/resources to the `lawnchair/` subdirectory and try to make as little changes as necessary directly inside Launcher3 code.
Kotlin is preferred but we'll accept great contributions in Java as well. We'll happily accept all bug fixes and will most likely also accept your well thought out feature.

### Building

Alright, I admit it, our build variants are a bit of a mess right now. Make sure to choose one of the variants prefixed `lawnWithQuickstep*`
from the "Build Variants" menu in Android Studio.
